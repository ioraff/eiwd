Interface	net.connman.iwd.DeviceProvisioning [Experimental]
Object path	/net/connman/iwd/{phy0,phy1,...}/{1,2,...}

Methods		string StartEnrollee()

			Start a DPP enrollee. Currently only station devices are
			supported.

			Returns the enrollees URI

						net.connman.iwd.InvalidArguments

		string StartConfigurator()

			station devices are supported, and will only configure
			the enrollee to the currently connected network.

			Returns the configurator URI

			Possible errors:	net.connman.iwd.NotAvailable
						net.connman.iwd.NotConnected
						net.connman.iwd.NotConfigured
						net.connman.iwd.NotSupported
						net.connman.iwd.Busy

		string ConfigureEnrollee(string uri)

			Start a DPP configurator with an enrollees URI.
			Only connected station devices are supported and will
			only configure the enrollee to the currently connected
			network.

			This API is to handle the use case where the enrollee
			has shared its URI to IWD (unlike StartConfigurator)

			The URI for IWD is also returned which could be used
			in the same way as it is with StartConfigurator().

			Possible errors:	net.connman.iwd.NotAvailable
						net.connman.iwd.NotConnected
						net.connman.iwd.NotConfigured
						net.connman.iwd.NotSupported
						net.connman.iwd.Busy
